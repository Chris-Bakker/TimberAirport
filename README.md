# Timber Airport: Parametric Design

This project is part of a design challenge to develop a temporary, sustainable airport near Rotterdam The Hague Airport.

## Parametric Design Approach
This was the **first project I completed using Grasshopper**, and my goal was to develop a parametric model of the airport terminal to enable rapid iterations and adjustments. The **Timber_Airport.gh** file contains this parametric model, showcasing:
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Quickly adjusting the terminal design based on functional requirements.
- **Material Efficiency**: Optimizing timber use for structural stability and sustainability.
- **Circularity**: Embedding modular design principles for reuse and disassembly after the terminal's 15-year lifespan.

## Highlights
- Designed a timber terminal that integrates structural efficiency with modular adaptability.
- Ensured compliance with load paths, stability systems and functional requirements through parametric optimization.
- Leveraged Grasshopper to efficiently visualize design changes and adapt the terminal to various constraints.

## How to Use
- **Timber_Airport.gh**: Load this file in Rhino with Grasshopper to explore and adapt the parametric model.
